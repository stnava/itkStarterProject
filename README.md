itkStarterProject
=================

A starter ITK project for beginners

It assumes you built ITK elsewhere - and know where that is.

You can build several examples based on this setup.

Examples are here:

[ITK Examples](http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Examples)

Procedure:

1.  download and build ITK - see instructions elsewhere

2.  clone this project 

3.  mkdir bin in itkStarterProject directory ( or wherever )

4.  call  `ccmake ../`  if you are in the itkStarterProject/bin directory

5.  follow cmake instructions ... then you are done!
